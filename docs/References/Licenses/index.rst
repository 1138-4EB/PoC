.. [#f1] Formatted means, that reStructured Test (reST) markup is used to
   highlight headlines, to display lists as unordered or ordered lists and to
   emphasis special wording in bold. There is no change in words, spelling or
   paragraph numbering. The formatting is needed to allow a proper rendering
   with Sphinx and to create a correct toctree (Table of Content Tree).
