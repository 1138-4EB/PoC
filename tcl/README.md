# Tcl Procedures and Scripts

This directory provides a collection of code snippets to support the workflow
on Tcl-controlled tools. The tasks of Tcl scripts are quite versatile and
can be distinguished, at least, into:
* tool control, and
* constraint specification.
Both of these tasks typically demand inherently tool- or device-dependent
code. So, please, classify scripts into an appropriate subdirectory that
identifies:
* the targeted tool, or
* the target hardware platform.
